Exploratory DBMS

Hi folks! 

I've decided to build a new database management system because you can never have have enough database management systems!

I will be recording "episodes" in which I will be making some progress building it. Some may be streamed live and some may not, and I may be making some progress or episodes without any recording ...

I plan to have each episode be a commit in this repository to help follow along.

## Implementation notes

In each episode I will explore something and make some progress in a very minimalistic way; expect shortcuts, assumptions, and cheats on each and every step of the way!

I am following my normal coding flow. I usually start with some exploratory Test First code faking as much as I can. Sometimes using proper test frameworks and sometimes just a terminal app, the idea is the same: get a real quick feedback loop, focus on my goal, fake everything else. 
For example it would have been tempting to start computing statistics, parsing queries, introducing metadata and datatypes, etc. but this all has its time and place which I will get to eventually.

## About the name

Masad (מסד) is Hebrew for "Foundation", where a Database is called "Masad Netutim," (מסד נתונים) which translates to "foundation of data", or a "data base"

## Guarantees
This product is guaranteed to be under performing, unreliable, and likely to eat your homework. Do not build a business around it, pick something better off the shelf.
